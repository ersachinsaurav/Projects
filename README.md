# Projects
 This GitHub project folder contains a collection of practice works demonstrating my web development skills and knowledge. These projects showcase my ability to use a range of technologies and techniques, including web development, database management, and front-end design. Whether I am styling and marking up a website with HTML, CSS, and Smarty, making the UI interactive with JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX, working with server-side languages like PHP or interacting with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, these projects demonstrate my versatility and competence as a web developer. I have also utilized Bootstrap and Materialize in some of these projects for front-end styling. I have also worked with different frameworks of PHP and JavaScript, like CodeIgniter, ReactJS, and NodeJS. These projects demonstrate my ability to work with a variety of tools and technologies to create dynamic and functional web applications. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I have always been dedicated to creating high-quality, functional, and visually appealing projects.
